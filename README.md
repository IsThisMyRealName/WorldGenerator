# WorldGenerator
This is a unityproject to help understand different aproaches to procedual (world)generation.

Controls:
During play a new World can be generated by pressing "Enter"

The main component is the "WorldGenerator" script.

With it you can between world generation by random distribution, placing bigger prefabs and perlin noise.

Random distribution and prefabs are not very extensive. I mostly focused on the perlin noise.
